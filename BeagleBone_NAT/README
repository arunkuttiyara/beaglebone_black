How to connect beagle bone to your laptop via ethernet, but still enabling networking in beaglebonbe


1. Connect Beagle bone to your computer via USB serial cable, which will create a netwrok interface. In my Ubuntu system, it had a IP of 192.168.7.1 on eth1
2. On beaglebone, there was a usb0 interface with IP 192.168.7.2
3. In beaglebone add the route : route add default gateway 192.168.7.1
4. In host computer, execute below steps to enable packet forwarding
   a. sudo iptables -F // to delete exisiting ip table rules
   b. /sbin/iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE // enable NAT at the wlan0 interface in Ubuntu
   c. /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o wlan0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT // enable port forwarding
   d. sudo /sbin/iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth1 -j ACCEPT // enable reverse port forwarding 
5. Now from beaglebone black, ping 8.8.8.8, it should be able to connect to external network now.
